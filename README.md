### Objectives
• To discuss about the concepts of “place” and “region” in GIScience

• To explain the importance of these concepts in urban sciences/practice

• To bring forward methods and approaches to spatially define these concepts

• To showcase the [CityMe project](https://cityme.novaims.unl.pt/)

• To carry out a hands-on exercise

#### Abstract
City dwellers communicate and reason about the urban space in the form of regions and places. 
In the context of GIScience and urban studies, these two concepts overlap and
represent fundamental units in bottom-up partitions of urban space. 
Their perceptual and functional dimensions can be retrieved and collected through different methods, 
such as knowledge-based models or data-driven approaches. Sources of data include collaborative geospatial data 
(e.g., OSM), online user-generated content (UGC) and from participatory methods such as web surveys and 
sketch maps. Rendering the boundaries and spatial footprints of places and different types of regions 
(e.g., neighbourhoods, areas of interest, vernacular/cognitive regions) provides enriched information 
for those who want to map the city according to its citizens. The goal of this workshop is to bring 
forth research, initiatives, concepts and methods, as well as issues and limitations on unravelling 
and arranging the urban space into meaningful territories. In addition, participants will engage in a 
[hands-on exercise](https://github.com/CityMe-project/CityMe-workshop_exercise) In Jupyter Notebook environments,
we will generate shapes of historic neighbourhoods  using several sources of UGC data as well as compute 
agreement boundaries of different types of regions  in the city using data collected from a survey 
developed in the scope of the CityMe project in Lisbon,  Portugal.
